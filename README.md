## Personal Website

Thanks for visiting! This website is a work in progress and serves as a simple introduction to who I am and what I do. The design was heavily inspired by Tsodingâ€™s website, which I admire for its clean, minimalist approach. While this version is basic, I plan to develop it further with more personal features, project showcases, and blog posts in the near future.

Stay tuned for updates as I work on making this site a true reflection of my skills, passions, and journey. Thanks for your patience and for checking it out!
